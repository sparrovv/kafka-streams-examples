# kafka streams examples

This repository contains a few examples I used in my kafka streams presentation on how to mix Processor API with streams DSL.

Examples contain:

- Basic streams DSL app
- Using joins
- Using KeyValue stores and persisting objects for deduplication
- Using WallClock scheduler to delay messages
